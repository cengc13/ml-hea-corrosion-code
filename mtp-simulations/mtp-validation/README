Validation of MTP predictions by finding which single-phase crystals are most stable for Alx(CrFeNiCo)_{100-x}, B2 versus L12 versus FCC_A1.

- fcc_A1.py: generate fcc_A1 structures and optimize its both cell geometry and atomic positions. 

- b2.py: generate b2 structures and optimize them

- l12.py: generate l12 structures and optimize them

- A1_vs_l12_vs_b2.py: compare the cohesive energies of B2 versus L12 versus fcc_A1 for each Al compositoin of Alx(CrFeNiCo)_{100-x}  

Note: When the cell and atomic positions were simultaneously optimized, ASE gave some errors. Instead, those two are optimized sequentially.
We first perform optimization of atomic positions, then cell geometry and lastly another round of position adjustment.

- nvt_hea.py: running 5000-step Langevin dynamics at a T=1700 K. The MD trajectory is named `bulk_md_nvt_1700K_al[Al composition].traj`.

- select_image.py: select images using farthest point sampling implemented in AMP. The selected image for each Al composition is named `chosen_bulk_al[Al composition].traj`.

*Note: AMP is an atomistic machine learning package developed by the Peterson group at Brown University.

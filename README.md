# ml-hea-corrosion-code
Scripts and notebooks for "machine learning corrosion-resistant high-entropy alloys".

- "single-phase-HEA" includes files for the machine learning models used to predict single-phase formability of high-entropy alloys.

- "eam-sampling" includes scripts to reproduce the fast sampling of high-entropy alloy configurations using embedded atom method (EAM)

- "first-principles-calculations" includes example scripts to perform high-throughput DFT calculations and how to generate simple representative bulk and surface structures with one to five elements.

- "mtp-training" includes the training data and a script to train MTP for AlCrFeNiCo.

- "mtp-simulations" includes scripts that use trained MTP to perform simulations targeting the three corrosion metrics and supporting results shown in SI.

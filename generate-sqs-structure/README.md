- Command to find the special quasi-random structure is as simple as `mcsqs -n=[number of elements]`. 
Details of other arguments for the command can be found [in this work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0364591613000540)

- The initial lattice file for each sqs structure incluidng three to five elements is given by `rndstr.in`.

- The numbers of atoms for ternary, quaternary and quinary structures are 27, 24 and 25, respetively.

- Python scripts to convert the generated sqs structure in atat format to ase compatabile format are adapted from the github repo:https://github.com/jkitchin/python-atat.

At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for
MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach
each other.  This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting to
specify the "self" BTL.

  Process 1 ([[53916,0],23]) is on host: c0484
  Process 2 ([[53916,0],0]) is on host: c0484
  BTLs attempted: self

Your MPI job is now going to abort; sorry.

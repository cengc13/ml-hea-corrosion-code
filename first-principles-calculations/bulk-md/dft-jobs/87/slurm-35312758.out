plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

You may wish to try to narrow down the problem;

 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.
 * Run your application with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
 * Set the MCA parameter btl_base_verbose to 100 (or mtl_base_verbose,
   if using MTL-based communications) to see exactly which
   communication plugins were considered and/or discarded.

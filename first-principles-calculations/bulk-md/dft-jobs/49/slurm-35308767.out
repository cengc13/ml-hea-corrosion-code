 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.

MPI_INIT has failed because at least one MPI process is unreachable
from another.  This *usually* means that an underlying communication
plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for
MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach
each other.  This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting to
specify the "self" BTL.

  Process 1 ([[50399,0],24]) is on host: c0470
  Process 2 ([[50399,0],0]) is on host: c0470
  BTLs attempted: self

Your MPI job is now going to abort; sorry.
